# countdown
Plan, organize and build the website, using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, and Javascript. For the timer you can use a special font to display numbers and digits. Use input fields to configure, and buttons to control the timer.


General

Use Figma for drawing the mockup.
Use VS Code, Live Server, Git/GitHub for developing and source control.

Additional ideas

Display text, icon or image below the timer when the countdown is over.
Play sound when the countdown is over.
Add buttons with duration presets which immediately restart the countdown.
Advanced: Shape the timer as a smaller box. When a countdown is started, move the timer-box permanently within the current screen rectangle, bouncing back from the borders of the screen.
